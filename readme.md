## Top-Down Roguelite Driving Game

Welcome to our top-down roguelite driving game! In this game, your goal is to enhance your character, i.e., your vehicle, and progress through as many levels as possible. Each level features several waves of ordinary enemies and one final boss encounter. To proceed to the next level, you must defeat its boss.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Enemy Encounters**: Encounter regular enemy waves throughout each level. You have the option to engage them as you progress.
- **Boss Fights**: Each level culminates in a challenging boss battle. Defeating the boss is crucial to advancing.
- **Progression System**: After successfully clearing enemy waves, you'll be presented with choices to upgrade your vehicle. Enhancements may include increased speed, improved braking, enhanced weaponry, and more.
- **Roguelite Elements**: Progression is not saved, and losing all your health points means starting over from the first level, losing all upgrades.
- **Currency System**: Earn currency upon completing the game or reaching significant milestones. Use this currency to purchase permanent upgrades, such as new vehicles or incremental improvements to your current one.
